1.
Given the provided data, what are three conclusions that we can draw about crowdfunding
campaigns?
We can say that top 3 categories with the highest number of campaigns were Theater, Film and Video
and Music where Theater had the highest ratios of both
successful (18.7%) and failed (13.2%) campaigns. Plays from the Category Theater had the highest number of successful campaigns (187).
76,3% of all campaigns were from US and that US was always a top contributor.
2.
What are some limitations of this dataset ?
The year 2020 seems to be only partially present in the dataset thus, trend analysis is inaccurate.
We do not know if the dataset contains all campaigns and represents all populations or if this is just a
sample.
3.
What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional
value would they provide?
We can look at the trends over the years to see that the number of successful campaigns grew, and the
number of failed campaigns declined YoY.
We can look at number of backers per campaign outcome to see that the successful campaigns had the
highest number of backers. We can assume that this can be a possible reason why some campaigns
failed was not sufficient or low number of backers. Or we can see that more than 50% of the campaigns were successful.
We could calculate the campaign duration to see if there is any correlation between the campaign length and the success rate.
